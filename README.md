# Capture the Flag (CTF) for Battlefield 2042 

Get to the opposing flag to pick it up and carry it back to your base. If the flag carrier gets killed, the flag is dropped at his position and will return to its base after 15 seconds. The team scoring 3 points as first, wins the round.

Flag icons with current state text will help you understand what's happening with your or the enemy flag. A triangle base icon and base name will appear when flag isn't home. Voice overs, notifications and sounds will play when a flag is taken, dropped, reset or captured.
